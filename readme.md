# Real-Time Edge Processing for Object Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on real-time object detection using edge devices. It employs advanced models like YOLOv5 for detecting various objects, including fire, weapons, and other threats. The system is designed to work on edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson to ensure low-latency and efficient processing.

## Features

- Real-time object detection
- Edge processing with NVIDIA Jetson
- Model optimization for fire, weapon, and threat detection
- Easy integration with edge devices

## Project Structure
-Notebooks Folder :- Contains yolov5 training notebook which is primarily used to train the model using the annotated image from the roboflow API.
-src/model Folder :- Contains the detect.py and the .pt models which are used to perform the detection.
